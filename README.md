# Thijs Dregmans

- 👋 Hi, I'm Thijs Dregmans (@tdregmans)
- 👀 I'm interested in programming, technology, running, self-improvement, writing, philosophy and almost all other forms of knowledge.
- 🌐 I'm also on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tdregmans/).
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about Quantum Computers
- 🎓 I'm currently studying Computer Science (🇳🇱 Technische Informatica) at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (🇳🇱 Hogeschool Rotterdam) in the Netherlands.
- 🔬 I'm doing my Minor Applied Quantum Computing at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
- 💻 A big part of the code I wrote during my education is put on Github. For the code I wrote for courses and projects during my Bachelor, specifcally look for [archived repositories starting with 'TIN'](https://github.com/tdregmans?tab=repositories&q=TIN&type=archived&language=&sort=name).
  There may also be some optional courses I did which [start with 'CMI'](https://github.com/tdregmans?tab=repositories&q=CMI&type=archived&language=&sort=name).
- ⚡ I also store my code for Applied Quantum Computing here. Look for [repositories starting with '5000Q'](https://github.com/tdregmans?tab=repositories&q=5000Q&type=archived&language=&sort=name).
- 💡 Other repositories are likely personal projects. If there is no owner or other stakeholders mentioned, this is most likely the case. *Note that not all personal projects are public; though some may be in the future.*
